- Bridge availability changes
- System health checks

## üéØ Expected Demo Results

In a typical 5-minute demo session, you should see:

- **20-30 arbitrage opportunities** detected
- **15-20 successful trades** executed  
- **2-4 flash loan** operations
- **1-2 cross-chain bridge** transfers
- **1-2 options strategies** deployed
- **5-15% portfolio growth** (simulated)
